# Introduction

Welcome to Intro to Deep Learning with Python.

If you know how to code in any language, you can build deep learning models from scratch.
Using Andrew Trask's Grokking Deep Learning as a guide, I'll be explaining how deep learning works in the way that best made sense to me.

```{python}
print("Hello, world!")

from fastai.vision.all import *
from fastbook import *

path = untar_data(URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE)

print(path.ls)

```
# Give me a neural network in 5 lines of code.

```{python}
for i in range(20):
  pred = input * weight 
  error = ( pred - goal_pred ) ** 2
  Derivative = input * (pred - goal_pred)
  weight = weight - (alpha * derivative)
  print
```
