# Introduction

This is a Quarto HTML file. It contains both text and code.

Here's an example code chunk in Python:

```{python}
print("Hello, world!")

from fastai.vision.all import *
from fastbook import *

path = untar_data(URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE)

print(path.ls)

```
# Give me a neural network in 5 lines of code.

```{python}
for i in range(20):
  pred = input * weight 
  error = ( pred - goal_pred ) ** 2
  Derivative = input * (pred - goal_pred)
  weight = weight - (alpha * derivative)
  print
```
